# finding_topics_in_news_articles_using_categorical
In this project, we will look for topics of discussion in news articles published by the New York Times using unsupervised machine learning. So that the model can provide news recommendations according to the preferences of readers.
We are doing some text cleaning, text tokenizing, using PCA to reduce dimension, using some clustering model from scikit-learn, using silhouette score and elbow method for evaluation.
We use python libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyploy, seaborn, scikit_learn.
